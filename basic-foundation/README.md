## 🚀 Getting Started

You can scaffold this template using [`degit`](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) if it's part of a GitHub repository:

```bash
npx degit suzubu/template-hub/basic-foundation
```

Or use it manually:

1. Clone or download the folder  
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser  
3. Begin editing `styles.css` and `script.js` to build your page

## 🧱 Best For

- Practicing or teaching raw HTML/CSS/JS
- Starting a component or layout from scratch
- Embedding minimal examples
- Avoiding build tools or setup overhead

---

## 🧼 Notes

- No CSS reset or utility classes included
- No meta frameworks or JavaScript libraries
- Add what you need — and nothing you don’t

Happy coding!
