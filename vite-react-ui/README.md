# Vite + React + Tailwind v4 UI Starter

A minimal, fast starter template for experimenting with React UI components using Tailwind CSS v4.1 and Vite.

This template is intentionally lightweight — perfect for when you want to prototype a component, animation, or small UI pattern without the overhead of a full framework or complex tooling.
